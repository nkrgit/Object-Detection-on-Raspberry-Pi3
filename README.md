# Object-Detection-on-Raspberry-Pi3

<h3>Main details:</h3>
<ul>Object detection is a computer vision technique that works to identify and locate objects within an image or video.</ul>

<ul>Specifically, object detection draws bounding boxes around these detected objects, which allow us to locate where said objects are in (or how they move through) a given scene. </ul>

<ul>Objects are detected using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD)), a convolutional approach, and this model can detect up to 90 different objects. </ul>

<ul>The model is trained over COCO dataset using Tensorflow API and converted to Tensorflow Lite to run on power efficient devices (i.e. IoT devices) like Raspberry pi </ul>

<h3>Tools used:</h3>
<ul>Raspbian Stretch (Operating System for Raspberry pi 3)</ul>
<ul>OpenCV library</ul>
<ul>TensorFlow Lite Framework</ul>
<ul> Web Cam (i.e. to feed live video data) </ul>
  
<h3>Improvements:</h3>
<ul>Using new raspberry pi models will give better FPS (i.e. frames per second)</ul>
<ul>Applications are not limited to Crowd counting, Self-driving cars, Video surveillance, Face detection, Anomaly detection.</ul>
